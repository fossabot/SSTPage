  Neural control of rising and falling tones in Mandarin people who stutter (PWS) was examined by comparing
  with that which occurs in fluent speakers [Howell, Jiang, Peng, and Lu (2012). Neural control of fundamental
  frequency rise and fall in Mandarin tones. Brain and Language, 121(1), 35-46]. Nine PWS and nine controls
  were scanned. Functional connectivity analysis showed that the connections between the insula and LMC and
  between the LMC and the putamen differed significantly between PWS and fluent speakers during both rising
  and falling tones. The connection between the insula and the brainstem differed between PWS and fluent
  speakers only during the falling tone. These results indicated the neural control for the rising tone and
  the falling tone are affected in PWS. Moreover, whilst both rising and falling tones were affected in PWS,
  falling-tone control appeared to be affected more.
