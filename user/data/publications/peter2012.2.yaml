  The neural mechanisms used in tone rises and falls in Mandarin were investigated. Nine participants were scanned
  while they named one-character pictures that required rising or falling tone responses in Mandarin: the left insula
  and right putamen showed stronger activation between rising and falling tones; the left brainstem showed weaker
  activation between rising and falling tones. Connectivity analysis showed that the significant projection from the
  laryngeal motor cortex to the brainstem which was present in rising tones was absent in falling tones. Additionally,
  there was a significant difference between the connection from the insula to the laryngeal motor cortex which was
  negative in rising tones but positive in falling tones. These results suggest that the significant projection from
  the laryngeal motor cortex to the brainstem used in rising tones was not active in falling tones. The connection from
  the left insula to the laryngeal motor cortex that differs between rising and falling tones may control whether the
  rise mechanism is active or not.
