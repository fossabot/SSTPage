  The neural mechanism of leader emergence is not well understood. This study investigated
  (i) whether interpersonal neural synchronization (INS) plays an important role in leader emergence, and
  (ii) whether INS and leader emergence are associated with the frequency or the quality of communications.
  Eleven three-member groups were asked to perform a leaderless group discussion (LGD) task, and their brain
  activities were recorded via functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based hyperscanning.
  Video recordings of the discussions were coded for leadership and communication. Results showed that the INS
  for the leader–follower (LF) pairs was higher than that for the follower–follower (FF) pairs in the left
  temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), an area important for social mentalizing. Although communication frequency
  was higher for the LF pairs than for the FF pairs, the frequency of leader-initiated and follower-initiated
  communication did not differ significantly. Moreover, INS for the LF pairs was significantly higher during
  leader-initiated communication than during follower-initiated communications. In addition, INS for the LF
  pairs during leader-initiated communication was significantly correlated with the leaders’ communication
  skills and competence, but not their communication frequency. Finally, leadership could be successfully
  predicted based on INS as well as communication frequency early during the LGD (before half a minute into
  the task). In sum, this study found that leader emergence was characterized by high-level neural synchronization
  between the leader and followers and that the quality, rather than the frequency, of communications was
  associated with synchronization. These results suggest that leaders emerge because they are able to say the
  right things at the right time.
