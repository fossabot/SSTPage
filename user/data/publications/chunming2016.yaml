  Speech production difficulties are apparent in people who stutter (PWS). PWS also have difficulties in
  speech perception compared to controls. It is unclear whether the speech perception difficulties in PWS
  are independent of, or related to, their speech production difficulties. To investigate this issue,
  functional MRI data were collected on 13 PWS and 13 controls whilst the participants performed a speech
  production task and a speech perception task. PWS performed poorer than controls in the perception task
  and the poorer performance was associated with a functional activity difference in the left anterior
  insula (part of the speech motor area) compared to controls. PWS also showed a functional activity
  difference in this and the surrounding area [left inferior frontal cortex (IFC)/anterior insula] in the
  production task compared to controls. Conjunction analysis showed that the functional activity differences
  between PWS and controls in the left IFC/anterior insula coincided across the perception and production tasks.
  Furthermore, Granger Causality Analysis on the resting-state fMRI data of the participants showed that the
  causal connection from the left IFC/anterior insula to an area in the left primary auditory cortex
  (Heschl's gyrus) differed significantly between PWS and controls. The strength of this connection correlated
  significantly with performance in the perception task. These results suggest that speech perception difficulties
  in PWS are associated with anomalous functional activity in the speech motor area, and the altered functional
  connectivity from this area to the auditory area plays a role in the speech perception difficulties of PWS.
