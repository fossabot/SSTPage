  Although the human brain may have evolutionarily adapted to face-to-face communication, other modes of
  communication, e.g., telephone and e-mail, increasingly dominate our modern daily life. This study
  examined the neural difference between face-to-face communication and other types of communication by
  simultaneously measuring two brains using a hyperscanning approach. The results showed a significant
  increase in the neural synchronization in the left inferior frontal cortex during a face-to-face dialog
  between partners but none during a back-to-back dialog, a face-to-face monologue, or a back-to-back
  monologue. Moreover, the neural synchronization between partners during the face-to-face dialog resulted
  primarily from the direct interactions between the partners, including multimodal sensory information
  integration and turn-taking behavior. The communicating behavior during the face-to-face dialog could be
  predicted accurately based on the neural synchronization level. These results suggest that face-to-face
  communication, particularly dialog, has special neural features that other types of communication do not
  have and that the neural synchronization between partners may underlie successful face-to-face communication.
